# wcm-io-devops.conga-aem-dispatcher-flush

This role flushes AEM dispatcher caches of a
[CONGA](http://devops.wcm.io/conga/) `aem-dispatcher` role.

## Requirements

This role requires Ansible 2.0 or higher.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with their default values:

        conga_aem_dispatcher_target_query: "*.*.flushTarget.url[]"

The jmespath query executed on the conga_config dict generated by
[wcm-io-devops.conga-facts](https://github.com/wcm-io-devops/ansible-conga-facts) to determine
the flush targets for the current CONGA role.

## Dependencies

This role depends on the
[wcm-io-devops.conga-facts](https://github.com/wcm-io-devops/ansible-conga-facts) role
for accessing the CONGA configuration model and
[wcm-io-devops.aem-dispatcher-flush](https://github.com/wcm-io-devops/ansible-aem-dispatcher-flush)
for executing the flush.

## Example Playbook

Flushes the dispatcher caches for the roles aem-author and aem-publish.
